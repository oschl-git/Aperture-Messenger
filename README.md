**Aperture Messenger** is a CLI messaging client for communication in Aperture Science, a fictional research facility from Valve's shared Portal and Half-Life universe.

Aperture Messenger connects to [**ALMS**](https://github.com/oschl-git/alms), a NodeJS REST API server which serves as a backend for its communication functionality.
